# Copilot instructions — pdeforecastingblog

Purpose: Help AI coding agents be immediately productive editing this Jekyll blog repository.

Big picture
- This is a single-page Jekyll blog post site (source at repository root). Content lives in `_posts/` and is rendered to the generated site in `_site/`.
- Layouts are in `_layouts/` (see `_layouts/default.html` for global HTML and MathJax config; `_layouts/post.html` for post structure).
- Styling and static assets live under `assets/` (CSS in `assets/css/style.css`).

Where to edit (source vs generated)
- Edit source files only: `_posts/*.md`, `_layouts/*.html`, `_config.yml`, `assets/*`, `Gemfile`.
- Do NOT edit files under `_site/` — they are build artifacts and will be regenerated by Jekyll.

Build / preview / deploy (concrete commands)
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  bundle install
  ```
- Run local preview (builds and serves at http://localhost:4000):
  ```bash
  bundle exec jekyll serve
  ```
- Deploy helper (requires a Unix-like shell):
  ```bash
  ./deploy.sh   # interactive; see DEPLOYMENT.md for steps
  ```
- Notes for Windows: use Git Bash or WSL to run `./deploy.sh`; the `Gemfile` includes `wdm` for Windows watchers.

Project-specific conventions & examples
- Front matter: posts must include `layout: post`; to enable MathJax rendering add `math: true`. Example:
  ```yaml
  ---
  layout: post
  title: "My Title"
  date: 2026-02-04
  categories: [example]
  author: Author Name
  description: Short blurb
  math: true
  ---
  ```
- Math: `_config.yml` uses `kramdown` with `math_engine: mathjax`. `_layouts/default.html` loads MathJax via CDN and configures `$$` / `$` handling — use `$$...$$` for display math.
- Permalinks: `_config.yml` sets `collections.posts.permalink: /:year/:month/:day/:title/`. Use post filenames `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` to match expectations.
- Base URL: when publishing as a project site, update `baseurl` in `_config.yml` to `"/REPO-NAME"` and commit.

Files to inspect for common tasks
- Content edits: `_posts/*.md`
- Layout or Math changes: `_layouts/default.html`, `_layouts/post.html`
- Styling: `assets/css/style.css`
- Dependencies/build: `Gemfile`, `_config.yml`
- Deployment helper & docs: `deploy.sh`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `README.md`

Committing and CI
- `_site/`, `vendor/`, `node_modules/` are excluded in `_config.yml` and should not be committed.
- Typical commit pattern: small, focused commits (e.g., `Update post: fix equation formatting`).

Quick checklist for an edit
1. Edit source (`_posts/`, `_layouts/`, or `assets/`).
2. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and verify locally (check MathJax rendering and CSS).
3. Commit only source files; do not commit `_site/`.
4. Push to GitHub; enable Pages (branch `main`, folder `/`) or follow `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

If anything is missing or unclear here, tell me which area (build, layout, front matter, math, or deployment) you want expanded and I will iterate.
